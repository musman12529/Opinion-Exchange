## Process Analysis


# Agile Sprint Model Adaptation:

1. Sprint Planning:
- Duration: 3 weeks.
- Backlog Refinement: Review the backlog, including user feedback and professor inputs.
- Sprint Goal: Establish a clear objective for the sprint based on user feedback and priorities.

2. Backlog Grooming:
- Prioritization: Arrange tasks from the backlog based on their priority and feasibility.
- Task Breakdown: Divide tasks into smaller, manageable user stories or tasks for implementation.
- Estimation: Assign story points or time estimates to tasks.

3. Sprint Execution:
- Daily Stand-ups: Conduct brief daily meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
- Task Assignment: Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise and capacity.
- Development: Implement user stories or tasks planned for the sprint duration.
- Continuous Integration: Regularly integrate completed work into individual branch.

4. Sprint Review:
- Demo: Demonstrate completed work to team members and gather feedback.
- Feedback Analysis: Discuss feedback received and plan for necessary adjustments or improvements.
- Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on what went well, what could be improved, and actions for the next sprint.

5. Sprint Closure:
- Documentation: Update documentation reflecting the changes made during the sprint.
- Code Review: Ensure thorough code reviews following SOLID and DRY principles.
- Merge to Master: Merge tested and approved work into the master branch at the end of the sprint.


## Changes in Process Since the Beginning of the Project:
- An agile sprint model was adopted
- Increased feedback analysis, this happened infromally through messages and social media communications and formally through team meetings
- Daily Standups was introduced so that we can do a quick recap of task progress by team members. 
- Continouns improvement on the use of the Kanban Board; use of labels, status, and colors
- Had to make changes in the Architecture documentaion.
- added hypothetical folder to describe changes that could have been made.
- More unit test were added for the server test since the last time.


## Ideas for improving process in future and what will team do about it:
- Nothing much, as this is the final sprint.
- Add professor's feedback as Backlog tasks
- Improved code review where team members can look beyond SOLID and DRY (Not covered in this course)
- Introducing the use of Milestones to group related sprints
