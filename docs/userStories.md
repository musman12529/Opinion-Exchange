For the final sprint, the team is once again met with many issues. These many issues, were issues described in past sprints that were not propely implemnted: mainly organizational skills.
Due to finals, late grading, and sickness, our teams organization skills fell to worse than it was before the previous sprints, making it very difficult to follow along and propely document the process as wanted by the Professor.
This led to the simple project being much more difficult than it should be. I found myself being over-stressed trying to manage all the courses and trying to organize the group.
I believe the team felt the same way, as it seemed during each sprint, less and less effort was given towards this course and projects.
Nonetheless, our team managed to complete all the tasks we were assigned and built on throughout the sprints, as well as updating bugs and errors along the way.
My tasks for this sprint were to add password hashing feature to the server (sprint 3 additional feature #1 on kanban). I completed this task pretty early amongst the sprint and spent most of the time
having to wait for other members to review. This added more stress, as well as myself having to be on members more than I felt I should have.
Additionally, I had to implement other methods such as Settings drop down to view and test the server, as well as add another potential method/feature so that the team had enough features. This did not get used as an additional feature as the group decided otherwise.
Considering another factor of this sprint which we lost great marks to in the last and heavily discussed by the prof: Architecture design. In the previous sprint, I had mentioned to the team and on the Kanban board as well as asking the professor what we should do for this.
In my understanding after discussing with the professor, I believed the architecture to be a single document for all developers: 1 design which entails all of server implementations/
The team viewed this another way, and decided on doing 1 architecture for each member. After recieiving the marks back from sprint 2, it was clear that a single architecture - NOT MULTIPLE - were wanted.
This and the new sprint 3 design (micro-architecture) are something I tried to discuss heavily with the team amongst the start of the sprint. There was little interest or discussing on completing this - and the team focused rather on the server prodcut, therefore this was 
left until the end of the sprint, where I then had to work on by myself as I had finals to study for and could not spend anymore time waiting for the team or myself to complete.
It is also very confusing how the professor states how he wants us to proceed with something, and when we do our grades do not reflect it - and upon further investigation was due to T.A's marking the project and overlooking many, many, MANY, things that were mentioned by the professor that would increase our grade.
Overall, this sprint and course in general have been very difficult. It started off alright, but ended up becoming very convoluted. I am extremely glad to be finished this course.
