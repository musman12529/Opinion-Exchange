  - He has been up to date and performed code reviews and PR's on time and when requested.
  - Usman has greatly helped the team and shown great improvements since last sprint
  - It would be really helpful for next sprint if usman could be more detailed on Code reviews and documentation, this will show alot more proof of team contribution
  - At times, it seeems as the group (myself being prime candidate) talk over Usman and give him less chances to speak. In next sprint, group should try to give Usman more chances to speak.

**Reviews for: Ibrahim**

   - Ibrahim has been a difficult group member to work with due to not being able to physically attend, and the rest of the group generally attending the meeting in physical.
   - He shows interest in completing the tasks at hand and tries to complete them before the deadline.
   - Is not really interactive in group chats unless specifically called upon. Would be helpful for more leadership in future sprints, lessening loads for others.
   - Has succesfully completed most items before first final sprint push

    Ibrahim has been successful in completing tasks assigned to him. Due to personal reasons however, Ibrahim has not been able to be present in person in any of our meetings.
