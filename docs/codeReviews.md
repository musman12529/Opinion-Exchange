# Code review

Could go in depth and summarize every code review we performed during the sprint, but that would take a great deal of time
and makes no sense as the code review is presented on many other documents: Meeting notes, kanban, commits and mainly PR's

If the marker goes and checks the history of these, they will be able to see documented and time-stamped proof for students code reviews
